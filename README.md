Decompiled version of LithTools by HeyThereCoffeee to fix PS2 levels and textures

Set up folder containing textures (tex folder) in settings.cfg in LTDatReader folder.
Attention: setting export_to_lta_on_load =true OVERWRITES the original ltb file!

Use Godot_v3.5.3-stable_win64.exe with this project
